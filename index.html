    <h1>All You Need To Know About<strong> BABI</strong></h1>
    <h2>IF U ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 30 OR LIVING WITH YOUR PARENTS. THIS IS FOR YOU!!!!!!!!</h2>
    <div class="checklist"><div class="checklist__list"><ul><li>Pigs are smart! Their intelligence is higher than a <a>dog's,unlike </a> some primates and even young human children³.<strong>UNLIKE YOU. ALWAYS GET B LAH C LAH OR WORST D LAH.</strong></li><li>In their natural state, pigs are very clean animals. They keep their toilets far from their living or feeding areas. <strong>BUT YOU ARE THE EXACT OPPOSITE. WAKEUP DONT KNOW TO MAKE THE BED. MAKE YOUR MOTHER DO.</strong></li><li>They are much more tolerant of colder temperatures than heat. Pigs have no sweat glands so they can't sweat. This is why they enjoy being in mud to keep themselves cool. <strong>BUT YOU 5 SECONDS CANNOT TAHAN WITHOUT A/C. YOUR MOTHER ELECTRICITY BILL SO HIGH BECAUSE OF A/C. NANTI KAU TAU!</strong></li><li>When they are trained piglets can learn their names at just two to three weeks old. They can learn to respond when called and learn tricks faster than dogs.<stronhg>BUT YOU ALWAYSSSS ON GAME GAME GAME. CALL ALSO CANNOT RESPOND. BABI ALSO MORE DISCIPLINE THAN YOU!!!!</stronhg></li><li>Pigs use grunts to communicate with each other. The grunts made by pigs vary depending on the pig's personality and can convey important information about the welfare of this highly social species¹.<strong>BUT YOU DAMNNNNNNNNN ANTI-SOCIAL. DURING ONLINE CLSS WONT TALK A WORD. NEVER GO OUT. I DONT EVEN THINK YOU HAVE FRIENDS, SAYS YO MAMA!</strong></li><li>Pigs have excellent memories. They can remember things for years and can recognize and remember objects!<strong>BUT YOUUUUU, YOU YESTERDAY TEACHER GIVE U HOMEWORK TODAY YOUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU FORGET. BUT TO BUY SOMETHING FOR YOU CAN REMEMBER FOR 8 YEARS!!!!!</strong></li><li>Newborn piglets learn to respond to their mothers’ voices, and mother pigs communicate with their babies through grunts while nursing. Scientific research has found that piglets have a certain teat order and each piglet has its own teat to suckle from.<strong>YOUR MOTHER CALL U A MILLION TIMES CANNOT RESPOND. SOME GUY FROM UK CALL U CAN RESPOND. YOURE MOTHER WOULD BE THINKING I COULD HAVE BREED SOME COWS INSTEAD OF GIVING BIRTH TO YOU AND GET MARRIED TO YOUR UGLY FATHER!!!!!!!!</strong></li><li>Pigs like to get massages, enjoy scratching themselves on trees, relaxing while listening to music, and playing with enrichment toys.<strong>BUT WHEN YOUR MOTHER ASK U TO MASSAGE HER U CANNOT MASSAGE. BUT THEY MUST MASSAGE FOR UUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU. YO MAMA STILL THINKING WHY SHE NEVER PUT YOU IN A ADOPTION CENTRE YOU SPOIED BRAT.</strong></li><li>The highest density of tactile receptors is found in the pig’s snout. Pigs use it mainly to dig in the dirt and smell food. A pig’s sense of smell is about 2000 times more sensitive than human's.<strong>U AND BABI SAMEM LAH. YOUR MOTHER COOK FOR U U SAID PLAYING GAME BUT WHEN SMELL YOUR MOTHERS COOKING YOU COME STRAIGHT TO THE DINING TABLE. AT THIS POINT YO MAMA WOULD BE PISSED!!</strong></li><li>Pigs are incredibly social. They form close bonds with each other and other animals. To keep warm, pigs may cuddle up with one another.<strong>LIKE I SAID YOU BABI</strong></li></ul></div></div>
